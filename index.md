## Interests

- First year MPH student at Columbia Mailman School interested in social determinants of health. 
- Lover of historical fiction, biographies, and well-narrated audiobooks.
- A green tea fanatic.

## Current Project

I quantify and analyze population mortality rates using Guatemalan census data at the University of Denver Ethnography Lab. I work to highlight health inequality and communicate those disparities through academic content (check out my published papers).
