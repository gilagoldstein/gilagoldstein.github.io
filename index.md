## Interests

- MPH student at Columbia Mailman School interested in social determinants of health. 
- Lover of historical fiction, biographies, and well-narrated audiobooks.
- Travel enthusiest: Ask me about my time backpacking or as a luxury travel agent.
- A green tea fanatic and the unofficial #1 fan of french fries.

## Current Project

I quantify and analyze population mortality rates using Guatemalan census data at the University of Denver Ethnography Lab. I work to highlight health inequality and communicate those disparities through academic content (check out my published papers).
